## Hi!

<img height="48" src="https://zoroark.guru/favicon.png" alt="profile picture">

:wave: I'm Matthieu, a French CS student at [EPITA](https://www.epita.fr/en). I go by "utybo" or "Zoroark" online. I started coding by making (crappy) Minecraft mods in Java and went on from there. I primarily value painlessness and ease of use without sacrificing on performance. A fast system is worthless if no one can figure out how to use it ! :smile:

üë®‚Äçüéì I studied C, C++, Java, Python, C# and JavaScript/TypeScript at school and code in Kotlin in my free time. I was a teaching assistant for 1st and 3rd year students (ACDC (C# and OCaml), YAKA (Java, JavaScript, C++), ACU (C, UNIX Shell, SQL)) at EPITA.

üõ† I have several ongoing projects. My current project is [Tegral](https://tegral.zoroark.guru) ([github](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral)), a web framework for Kotlin that uses cool, existing libraries, and merge them into one somewhat cohesive experience. It also has a bunch of "advanced" libraries for things like  [dependency injection](https://tegral.zoroark.guru/docs/modules/core/di/) and [OpenAPI in the Kotlin ecosystem](https://tegral.zoroark.guru/docs/modules/core/openapi/). I've also worked on **[EpiLink](https://epilink.zoroark.guru)** ([repo](https://github.com/EpiLink/EpiLink)), a web service for authenticating Discord users on chat servers based on their Microsoft/Office 365/OpenID Connect accounts, which we currently use for all of the (somewhat-official-but-not-really) EPITA Discord servers. I also have several other Kotlinish experiments on my profile.

üåê My website is [zoroark.guru](https://zoroark.guru), although there isn't really much happening on there.

üí¨ You can send me a message on Telegram [@utybo](https://t.me/utybo) if you want to chat about something (I may be a bit slow to respond, sorry!)
