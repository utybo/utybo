## Hi ! 

<img height="48" src="https://zoroark.guru/favicon.png" alt="profile picture">

:wave: I'm Matthieu, a French CS student at [EPITA](https://www.epita.fr/en/). I go by "utybo" or "Zoroark" online. I started coding by making (crappy) Minecraft mods in Java and went on from there. I primarily value painlessness and ease of use without sacrificing on performance. A fast system is worthless if no one can figure out how to use it ! :smile:

👨‍🎓 I study C at school and code in Kotlin in my free time. I also know a thing or two about Java. I am currently an ACDC (Assistant C Dièse Caml, OCaml and C Sharp teaching assistant) at EPITA.

🛠 My biggest project yet is **[EpiLink](https://epilink.zoroark.guru)** ([repo](https://github.com/EpiLink/EpiLink)), a web service for authenticating Discord users on chat servers based on their Microsoft/Office 365 accounts, which we currently use for all of the (somewhat-official-but-not-really) EPITA Discord servers. I also [experiment](https://github.com/utybo/Lixy) with [other](https://github.com/utybo/Pangoro) Kotlin-ish [things](https://github.com/utybo/ktor-rate-limit).

🌐 My website is [zoroark.guru](https://zoroark.guru), although there isn't really much happening on there.

💬 You can send me a message on Telegram [@utybo](https://t.me/utybo) if you want to chat about something (I may be a bit slow to respond, sorry!)
